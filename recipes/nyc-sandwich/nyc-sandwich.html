    <p> Total time to cook: 20 minutes </p>
    <p> Yields 2 servings of sandwiches </p>

    <h2> Ingredients </h2>
    <ul>
        <li>  4 strips bacon </li>
        <li>  2 Kaiser rolls, sliced in half horizontally </li>
        <li>  4 tablespoons unsalted butter, divided </li>
        <li>  4 large eggs, lightly whisked </li>
        <li>  4 slices American cheese </li>
        <li>  ketchup, for serving <em> (optional) </em> </li>

    </ul>

    <h2> Directions </h2>
    <ol> 
        <li> <p> Place bacon in a large skillet and cook over medium-high heat, turning occasionally, until crisp, about 10 minutes. </p> <p> Drain bacon slices on paper towels. </p> </li>
        <li> <p> Melt 2 tablespoons butter in a large nonstick pan or griddle over low heat. </p> <p> Add Kaiser rolls, cut sides down, and toast until lightly golden, about 3 minutes. Remove and set aside. </p> </li>
        <li> <p> For each sandwich, melt 1 tablespoon butter in the skillet. </p> 
             <p> Pour half the eggs into the pan, and cook as if making an omelet, pushing eggs aside and lifting to allow uncooked egg to run underneath. </p> 
             <p> Layer 1 slice of cheese, 2 slices bacon, and 1 slice cheese onto half of the cooked egg, and fold the other half over the top. </p>
             <p> Add this to a toasted Kaiser roll, and wrap the roll in foil to steam. Repeat with remaining sandwich ingredients. </p> </li>
        <li> <p> Slice in half and serve with ketchup. <em> (Optional) </em> </p> 
    </ol>
