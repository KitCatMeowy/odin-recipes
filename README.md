In this project, I will be building a basic recipe website, which will 
include 3 different recipes for dishes of my choice.

I will have linked the original authors of the recipes in the webpage.

I'll be making use of the knowledge on how to write out a HTML boilerplate, as well as how to create ordered and unordered lists, headings, embedding hyperlinks and various text embellishments.
